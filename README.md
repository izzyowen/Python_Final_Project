In the pursuit of personalized medicine, large-scale studies are being performed that generate a plethora of data. In the study of cancer, this is particularly true. These studies generate large, publicly-accessible databases in which they store all of the data their study generates. This is an incredibly useful tool to allow reproducibility, as well as to move the science forward. One downside, however, is that these large deposits of data can be cumbersome and impossible to navigate.

One such project is called Project Achilles, a project of The Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard (https://portals.broadinstitute.org/achilles). From their website:
> Project Achilles is a systematic effort aimed at identifying and cataloging gene essentiality across hundreds of genomically characterized cancer cell lines. The project uses genome-scale RNAi and CRISPR-Cas9 genetic perturbation reagents to silence or knockout individual genes and identify those genes that affect cell survival. By linking these genetic dependencies to the genetic or molecular features of the tumors, this project is providing the foundation for a "Cancer Dependency Map" (https://depmap.org).
